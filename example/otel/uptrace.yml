## Uptrace configuration file.
## See https://uptrace.dev/get/config.html for details.
##
## You can use environment variables anywhere in this file, for example:
##
##   foo: $FOO
##   bar: ${BAR}
##   baz: ${BAZ:default}
##
## To escape `$`, use `$$`, for example:
##
##   foo: $$FOO_BAR

##
## ClickHouse database credentials.
##
ch:
  # Connection string for ClickHouse database. For example:
  # clickhouse://<user>:<password>@<host>:<port>/<database>?sslmode=disable
