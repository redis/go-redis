// counted as if the database had answered. A hook that answers locally
// belongs on the MultiDBClient (AddHook): it then runs before the gate and
// records nothing.
//
// A member hook must pass the context it receives — or one derived from it —
// to next. MultiDB carries per-batch execution tracking in context values:
// the pipeline paths attach it before entering the member's hook chain and
// the wire path reads it back to mark commands as executed. A hook that
// substitutes an unrelated context (context.Background() to detach
// cancellation, a freshly built deadline context) drops that value, so a batch

// failures not reset — never a phantom success or a replay.
//
// For a cluster member this installs the hook on the *ClusterClient's own
// process and pipeline chains only. It does not reach the per-node *Client
// instances the cluster dials internally, so a DialHook never runs for a
// cluster member's connections. There is currently no MultiDB API to reach
// those per-node clients. For the same reason a cluster member's hook does
