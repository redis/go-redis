// ReAuthPoolHook is a pool hook that manages background re-authentication of connections
// when credentials change via a streaming credentials provider.
//
// The hook uses a semaphore-based worker pool to limit concurrent re-authentication
// operations and prevent pool exhaustion. When credentials change, connections are
// marked for re-authentication and processed asynchronously in the background.
//
// The re-authentication process:
//  1. OnPut: When a connection is returned to the pool, check if it needs re-auth
//  2. If yes, schedule it for background processing (move from shouldReAuth to scheduledReAuth)
//  3. A worker goroutine acquires the connection (waits until it's not in use)
//  4. Executes the re-auth function while holding the connection
//  5. Releases the connection back to the pool
//
// The hook ensures that:
//   - Only one re-auth operation runs per connection at a time
//   - Connections are not used for commands during re-authentication
//   - Re-auth operations timeout if they can't acquire the connection
//   - Resources are properly cleaned up on connection removal
