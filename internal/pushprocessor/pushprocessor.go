package pushprocessor

// This is an EXPERIMENTAL API for push notifications.
// It is subject to change without notice.
// The handler interface may change in the future to include more or less context information.
// The handler context has fields that are currently empty interfaces.
// This is to allow for future expansion without breaking compatibility.
// The context information will be filled in with concrete types or more specific interfaces in the future.
